## Embedded Utilities

This repository is currently just a junkyard of various utilities I have written for different embedded projects, and I found it is time to get it all together into one library repository just to do the whole submodule thing in git and make my life a bit easier.

### Getting started

The libraries are developed with Python 3.5.3, so have a version somewhat close to that and you should be golden

To get started you just need to add the repository as a submodule:

`$ git submodule add {this repo}`

And install the requirements

`$Â pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

In addition to use the code in the subfolders here, follow the instructions in their specific subfolder.
